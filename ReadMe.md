# Animated Drink Slider

An interactive and animated drink product slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to switch between different drinks using a “Next” button, with smooth transitions that dynamically update the product image, background color, and drink name based on the selected item.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project showcases a modern UI concept for displaying beverage products in an engaging and visually appealing way. Each time the user clicks the navigation button, the slider animates to the next drink while changing the theme color of the background and updating the product title to match the drink’s identity.

The animations are created using CSS transitions and keyframes, while JavaScript handles the logic for changing content, colors, and active states. The result is a smooth and dynamic product browsing experience similar to what is commonly seen in modern e-commerce or brand websites.

This project is designed to demonstrate creative front-end development skills without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.
